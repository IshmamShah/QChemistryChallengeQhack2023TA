We are going to use the access to demonstrate the algorithms for Hamiltonians with larger size and evaluate the error tolerance of the algorithm. We plan to use a VQE while implementing qubit tapering to lower qubit count, quantum circuit cutting and reconstruction and probably also transforming our parameterized quantum circuits to tensor networks to lower runtime cost. Combining all these methods we should be able to get reasonable accuracy and speed in our simulation to find out the ground state energy of the given molecule.
